SPI implementation for deploying https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream[Spring Cloud Stream] modules to
 https://mesosphere.github.io/marathon[Marathon].

The SPI currently assumes that there will be a running redis Marathon app running.

One way to create one is to have Marathon run the `redis` docker image:

```
curl -X POST http://10.141.141.10:8080/v2/apps -d @redis.json -H "Content-type: application/json"
```

With `redis.json` containing

[source, json]
```
{
  "id": "redis",
  "cpus": 0.5,
  "mem": 64.0,
  "instances": 1,
  "container": {
    "type": "DOCKER",
    "docker": {
      "image": "redis"
    }
  }
}
```
