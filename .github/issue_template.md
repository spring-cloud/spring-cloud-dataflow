<!-- Thanks for the interest in Spring Cloud Data Flow! Before you create a new issue, please answer the following question.-->

**Is this a "Bug Report" or "Feature Request"?** _(choose one and remove the irrelevant sections before submitting the issue)_:

<!--
If this is a "Bug Report", please:

**Describe**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is. Additionally, it'd help if you can include the logs and entire stacktrace including the "caused by". _(see [GitHub Mardown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for logs/code formatting guidelines)_

**Release versions**
There's an [API](http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#api-guide-resources-server-meta-retrieving) to gather SCDF's system information including the dependent projects and the associated versions. Alternatively, you can capture this information from the Dashboard's [About](http://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/#dashboard) tab, so make sure to include the copied JSON in the bug report.

**Custom Apps**
If your Stream or Task data pipeline include custom apps and there's a problem associated with it, it'd be good to review the sample App and the release versions in use. Make sure to include the register, create, and deploy/launch DSL commands for completeness.

**To Reproduce**
Include the steps to reproduce the behavior. Better yet, if you have a reproducible sample, please attach it in the issue. It'd help us to relate to the problem more easily. 

**Screenshots**
Where applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.

**Additional context**
