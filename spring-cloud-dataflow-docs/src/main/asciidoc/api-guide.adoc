In this section you will learn all about the Spring Cloud Data Flow REST API.
--

[[api-guide-overview]]
== Overview

Spring Cloud Data Flow provides a  REST API allowing you to access all aspects of
the server. In fact the Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell is a first-class consumer of
that API.

TIP: If you plan on using the REST API using Java, please also consider using the
provided Java client (DataflowTemplate) that uses the REST API internally.

[[api-guide-overview-http-verbs]]
=== HTTP verbs

Spring Cloud Data Flow tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP verbs.

|===
| Verb | Usage

| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource

| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource

| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, including partial updates. Also used for
resources that imply the concept of `restarts` such as Tasks.

| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===

[[api-guide-overview-http-status-codes]]
=== HTTP status codes

RESTful note tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.

|===
| Status code | Usage

| `200 OK`
| The request completed successfully

| `201 Created`
| A new resource has been created successfully. The resource's URI is available from the response's `Location` header

| `204 No Content`
| An update to an existing resource has been applied successfully

| `400 Bad Request`
| The request was malformed. The response body will include an error providing further information

| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource did not exist

| `409 Conflict`
| The requested resource already exists, e.g. the task already exists or the stream
was already being deployed

| `422 Unprocessable Entity`
| Returned in cases the Job Execution cannot be stopped or restarted

|===

[[api-guide-overview-headers]]
=== Headers

Every response has the following header(s):

include::{snippets}/api-documentation/headers/response-headers.adoc[]

[[api-guide-overview-errors]]
=== Errors

include::{snippets}/api-documentation/errors/response-fields.adoc[]

[[api-guide-overview-hypermedia]]
=== Hypermedia

Spring Cloud Data Flow uses hypermedia and resources include links to other resources
in their responses. Responses are in http://stateless.co/hal_specification.html[Hypertext Application from resource to resource Language (HAL)] format. Links can be found beneath the `_links` key. Users of the API should not create URIs themselves, instead they should use the above-described links to navigate.

[[api-guide-resources]]
== Resources

[[api-guide-resources-index]]
=== Index

The index provides the entry point into Spring Cloud Data Flow's REST API.

[[resources-metrics-stream-applications]]
=== Metrics for Stream Applications

This REST endpoint exposes metrics for stream applications. This REST enpoint requires
the https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow-metrics-collector[Metrics Collector]
application to be running as a separate service. If not running, this endpoint will
return an empty response.

NOTE: In order to learn more about the Metrics Collector, please also refer to chapter
<<configuration-monitoring-deployed-applications>>

==== Request structure

For example, a typical request may look like:

include::{snippets}/metrics-for-stream-apps-without-collector-documentation/get-metrics-without-collector-running/http-request.adoc[]

==== Example request

include::{snippets}/metrics-for-stream-apps-without-collector-documentation/get-metrics-without-collector-running/curl-request.adoc[]

==== Response structure

This REST endpoint uses https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix[Hystrix] via the
https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-netflix[Spring Cloud Netflix] project
under the covers to make a proxy HTTP request to the Metrics Collector.

==== Example response

Therefore, the endpoint will not generate an error in case the
Metrics Collector is not running, but rather gracefully degrade and return an
empty response such as the following:

include::{snippets}/metrics-for-stream-apps-without-collector-documentation/get-metrics-without-collector-running/http-response.adoc[]

However, if metrics are being collected and the Metrics Collector is running you
should see a response similar to the listing below. The metrics data returned in
the listing below is based on the example stream definition created
in chapter <<configuration-monitoring-deployed-applications>> `time | log` with
two instances of each application deployed.
