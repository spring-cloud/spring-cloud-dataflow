[[create-containers]]

=== Create containers for architectures not supported yet.
In the case of macOS on M1 the performance of amd64/x86_64 is unacceptable.
We provide a set of scripts that can be used to download specific versions of published artifacts.
We also provide a script that will create a container using the downloaded artifact for the host platform.
In the various projects you will find then in `src/local` or `local` folders.

==== Scripts in `spring-cloud-dataflow`
===== `src/local/download-apps.sh`
Downloads all applications needed by `create-containers.sh` from Maven repository.

*If the timestamp of snapshots matches the download will be skipped.*

Usage: `download-apps.sh [version]`

* `version` is the dataflow-server version like `2.11.3`. Default is `2.11.3-SNAPSHOT`

===== `src/local/create-containers.sh`
Creates all containers and pushes to local docker registry.

This script requires link:https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib/tree/master/jib-cli[jib-cli]

Usage: `create-containers.sh [version] [jre-version]`

* `version` is the dataflow-server version like `2.11.3`. Default is `2.11.3-SNAPSHOT`
* `jre-version` should be one of 11, 17. Default is 11
