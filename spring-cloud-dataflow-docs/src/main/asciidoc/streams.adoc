== Introduction

In Spring Cloud Data Flow, a basic stream defines the ingestion of event driven data from a _source_ to a _sink_ that passes through any number of _processors_. Streams are composed of spring-cloud-stream applications and the deployment of stream definitions is done via the Data Flow Server (REST API). The xref:getting-started#getting-started[Getting Started] section shows you how to start these servers and how to start and use the Spring Cloud Data Flow shell.

A high level DSL is used to create stream definitions. The DSL to define a stream that has an http source and a file sink (with no processors) is shown below

```
http | file
```
The DSL mimics a UNIX pipes and filters syntax. Default values for ports and filenames are used in this example but can be overridden using `--` options, such as

```
http --server.port=8091 | file --directory=/tmp/httpdata/
```
To create these stream definitions you use the shell or make an HTTP POST request to the Spring Cloud Data Flow Server. More details can be found in the sections below.

== Creating a Simple Stream

The Spring Cloud Data Flow Server exposes a full RESTful API for managing the lifecycle of stream definitions, but the easiest way to use is it is via the Spring Cloud Data Flow shell. Start the shell as described in the xref:Getting-Started#getting-started[Getting Started] section.

New streams are created by posting stream definitions. The definitions are built from a simple DSL. For example, let's walk through what happens if we execute the following shell command:

```
dataflow:> stream create --definition "time | log" --name ticktock
```
This defines a stream named `ticktock` based off the DSL expression `time | log`.  The DSL uses the "pipe" symbol `|`, to connect a source to a sink.

Then to deploy the stream execute the following shell command (or alternatively add the `--deploy` flag when creating the stream so that this step is not needed):

```
dataflow:> stream deploy --name ticktock
```
The Data Flow Server resolves `time` and `log` to maven coordinates and uses those to launch the `time` and `log` applications of the stream.

```
2016-06-01 09:41:21.728  INFO 79016 --- [nio-9393-exec-6] o.s.c.d.spi.local.LocalAppDeployer       : deploying app ticktock.log instance 0
   Logs will be in /var/folders/wn/8jxm_tbd1vj28c8vj37n900m0000gn/T/spring-cloud-dataflow-912434582726479179/ticktock-1464788481708/ticktock.log
2016-06-01 09:41:21.914  INFO 79016 --- [nio-9393-exec-6] o.s.c.d.spi.local.LocalAppDeployer       : deploying app ticktock.time instance 0
   Logs will be in /var/folders/wn/8jxm_tbd1vj28c8vj37n900m0000gn/T/spring-cloud-dataflow-912434582726479179/ticktock-1464788481910/ticktock.time
```

In this example, the time source simply sends the current time as a message each second, and the log sink outputs it using the logging framework.
You can tail the `stdout` log (which has an "_<instance>" suffix). The log files are located within the directory displayed in the Data Flow Server's log output, as shown above.

```
$ tail -f /var/folders/wn/8jxm_tbd1vj28c8vj37n900m0000gn/T/spring-cloud-dataflow-912434582726479179/ticktock-1464788481708/ticktock.log/stdout_0.log
2016-06-01 09:45:11.250  INFO 79194 --- [  kafka-binder-] log.sink    : 06/01/16 09:45:11
2016-06-01 09:45:12.250  INFO 79194 --- [  kafka-binder-] log.sink    : 06/01/16 09:45:12
2016-06-01 09:45:13.251  INFO 79194 --- [  kafka-binder-] log.sink    : 06/01/16 09:45:13
```

If you would like to have multiple instances of an application in the stream, you can include a property with the deploy command:

```
dataflow:> stream deploy --name ticktock --properties "app.time.count=3"
```

IMPORTANT: See <<app-labels>>.

== Deleting a Stream

You can delete a stream by issuing the `stream destroy` command from the shell:

```
dataflow:> stream destroy --name ticktock
```

If the stream was deployed, it will be undeployed before the stream definition is deleted.

== Deploying and Undeploying Streams

Often you will want to stop a stream, but retain the name and definition for future use. In that case you can `undeploy` the stream by name and issue the `deploy` command at a later time to restart it.
```
dataflow:> stream undeploy --name ticktock
dataflow:> stream deploy --name ticktock
```

== Other Source and Sink Types

Let's try something a bit more complicated and swap out the `time` source for something else. Another supported source type is `http`, which accepts data for ingestion over HTTP POSTs. Note that the `http` source accepts data on a different port from the Data Flow Server (default 8080). By default the port is randomly assigned.

To create a stream using an `http` source, but still using the same `log` sink, we would change the original command above to

```
dataflow:> stream create --definition "http | log" --name myhttpstream --deploy
```
which will produce the following output from the server

```
2016-06-01 09:47:58.920  INFO 79016 --- [io-9393-exec-10] o.s.c.d.spi.local.LocalAppDeployer       : deploying app myhttpstream.log instance 0
   Logs will be in /var/folders/wn/8jxm_tbd1vj28c8vj37n900m0000gn/T/spring-cloud-dataflow-912434582726479179/myhttpstream-1464788878747/myhttpstream.log
2016-06-01 09:48:06.396  INFO 79016 --- [io-9393-exec-10] o.s.c.d.spi.local.LocalAppDeployer       : deploying app myhttpstream.http instance 0
   Logs will be in /var/folders/wn/8jxm_tbd1vj28c8vj37n900m0000gn/T/spring-cloud-dataflow-912434582726479179/myhttpstream-1464788886383/myhttpstream.http
```

Note that we don't see any other output this time until we actually post some data (using a shell command). In order to see the randomly assigned port on which the http source is listening, execute:

```
dataflow:> runtime apps
```
You should see that the corresponding http source has a `url` property containing the host and port information on which it is listening. You are now ready to post to that url, e.g.:
```
dataflow:> http post --target http://localhost:1234 --data "hello"
dataflow:> http post --target http://localhost:1234 --data "goodbye"
```
and the stream will then funnel the data from the http source to the output log implemented by the log sink

```
2016-06-01 09:50:22.121  INFO 79654 --- [  kafka-binder-] log.sink    : hello
2016-06-01 09:50:26.810  INFO 79654 --- [  kafka-binder-] log.sink    : goodbye
```

Of course, we could also change the sink implementation. You could pipe the output to a file (`file`), to hadoop (`hdfs`) or to any of the other sink apps which are available. You can also define your own apps.

== Simple Stream Processing

As an example of a simple processing step, we can transform the payload of the HTTP posted data to upper case using the stream definitions
```
http | transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | log
```
To create this stream enter the following command in the shell
```
dataflow:> stream create --definition "http | transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | log" --name mystream --deploy
```
Posting some data (using a shell command)
```
dataflow:> http post --target http://localhost:1234 --data "hello"
```
Will result in an uppercased 'HELLO' in the log

```
2016-06-01 09:54:37.749  INFO 80083 --- [  kafka-binder-] log.sink    : HELLO
```

== DSL Syntax

In the examples above, we connected a source to a sink using the pipe symbol `|`. You can also pass properties to the source and sink configurations. The property names will depend on the individual app implementations, but as an example, the `http` source app exposes a `server.port` setting which allows you to change the data ingestion port from the default value. To create the stream using port 8000, we would use
```
dataflow:> stream create --definition "http --server.port=8000 | log" --name myhttpstream
```
The shell provides tab completion for application properties and also the shell command `app info` provides some additional documentation.

=== Register a Stream App

Register a Stream App with the App Registry using the Spring Cloud Data Flow Shell
`app register` command. You must provide a unique name and a URI that can be
resolved to the app artifact. For the type, specify "source", "processor", or "sink".
Here are a few examples:

```
dataflow:>app register --name mysource --type source --uri maven://com.example:mysource:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT

dataflow:>app register --name myprocessor --type processor --uri file:///Users/example/myprocessor-1.2.3.jar

dataflow:>app register --name mysink --type sink --uri http://example.com/mysink-2.0.1.jar
```

When providing a URI with the `maven` scheme, the format should conform to the following:

```
maven://<groupId>:<artifactId>[:<extension>[:<classifier>]]:<version>
```

If you would like to register multiple apps at one time, you can store them in a properties file
where the keys are formatted as `<type>.<name>` and the values are the URIs. For example, this
would be a valid properties file:

```
source.foo=file:///tmp/foo.jar
sink.bar=file:///tmp/bar.jar
```

Then use the `app import` command and provide the location of the properties file via `--uri`:

```
app import --uri file:///tmp/stream-apps.properties
```

You can also pass the `--local` option (which is TRUE by default) to indicate whether the
properties file location should be resolved within the shell process itself. If the location should
be resolved from the Data Flow Server process, specify `--local false`.

When using either `app register` or `app import`, if a stream app is already registered with
the provided name and type, it will not be overridden by default. If you would like to override the
pre-existing stream app, then include the `--force` option.

[NOTE]
In some cases the Resource is resolved on the server side, whereas in others the
URI will be passed to a runtime container instance where it is resolved. Consult
the specific documentation of each Data Flow Server for more detail.

== Advanced Features

If directed graphs are needed instead of the simple linear streams described above, two features are relevant.

First, named destinations may be used as a way to combine the output from multiple streams or for multiple consumers to share the output from a single stream.
This can be done using the DSL syntax `http > :mydestination` or `:mydestination > log`.

Second, you may need to determine the output channel of a stream based on some information that is only known at runtime.
In that case, a router may be used in the sink position of a stream definition. For more information, refer to the Router Sink starter's
link:https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-stream-app-starters/tree/master/router/spring-cloud-starter-stream-sink-router[README].

[[app-labels]]
== App Labels

When a stream is comprised of multiple apps with the same name, they must be qualified with labels:
```
stream create --definition "http | firstLabel: transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | secondLabel: transform --expression=payload+'!' | log" --name myStreamWithLabels --deploy
```
[[tap-dsl]]
== Tap DSL

Taps can be created at various producer endpoints in a stream. For a stream like this:

```
stream create --definition "http | step1: transform --expression=payload.toUpperCase() | step2: transform --expression=payload+'!' | log" --name mainstream --deploy

```
taps can be created at the output of `http`, `step1` and `step2`.

To create a stream that acts as a 'tap' on another stream requires to specify the `source destination name` for the tap stream. The syntax for source destination name is:

```
`:<stream-name>.<label/app-name>`
```
To create a tap at the output of `http` in the stream above, the source destination name is `mainstream.http`
To create a tap at the output of the first transform app in the stream above, the source destination name is `mainstream.step1`

The tap stream DSL looks like this:

```
stream create --definition ":mainstream.http > counter" --name tap_at_http --deploy

stream create --definition ":mainstream.step1 > jdbc" --name tap_at_step1_transformer --deploy
```

Note the colon (:) prefix before the destination names. The colon allows the parser to recognize this as a destination name instead of an app name.

[[explicit-destination-names]]
== Connecting to explicit destination names at the broker

One can connect to a specific destination name located in the broker (Rabbit, Kafka etc.,) either at the `source` or at the `sink` position.

The following stream has the destination name at the `source` position:

```
stream create --definition ":myDestination > log" --name ingest_from_broker --deploy
```

This stream receives messages from the destination `myDestination` located at the broker and connects it to the `log` app.


The following stream has the destination name at the `sink` position:

```
stream create --definition "http > :myDestination" --name ingest_to_broker --deploy
```
This stream sends the messages from the `http` app to the destination `myDestination` located at the broker.

From the above streams, notice that the `http` and `log` apps are interacting with each other via the broker (through the destination `myDestination`) rather than having a pipe directly between `http` and `log` within a single stream.

It is also possible to connect two different destinations (`source` and `sink` positions) at the broker in a stream.

```
stream create --definition ":destination1 > :destination2" --name bridge_destinations --deploy
```

In the above stream, both the destinations (`destination1` and `destination2`) are located in the broker. The messages flow from the source destination to the sink destination via a `bridge` app that connects them.
